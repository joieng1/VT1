              <h3>Classes Offered and Structure</h3>
              <p>As our program focuses on helping students with homework, that is most of the content our tutors will be drawing from. However, for our summer program where we do focus on teaching, this is what you can expect to see! </p>
              <p><b>Elementary School English</b></p>
                <p>Welcome to English! Students will work on reading comprehension, grammer and much more! </p>
              <p><b>Elementary School Math</b></p>
                <p>Welcome to arithmetic! From addition to division, to fractions and decimals, we'll be working with whole numbers to get the very foundations of math into your child's brain</p>
              <p><b>Middle School English</b></p>
                <p>Begin working on the fundamentals of analysis and writing. At the same time, improve your grammar skills by writing a narrative!</p>
              <p><b>Middle School Math</b></p>
                <p>In these classes, we continue to explore fractions and learn to interpret graphs and data. We begin to work with geometry and the very basics of Algebra.</p>
              <p><b>Algebra 1</b></p>
                <p>In Algebra 1, we give our students the key topics. From linear equations to the quadratic formula, we cover the material necessary to make your student  comfortable in their high school math classes!</p>

              <h3>Office Hours</h3>
                <p>If your child needs help outside of their scheduled tutoring time and their tutor is not available to help, they can attend the office hours once a week on Mondays from 3:15-4:15. We ask that your student comes to these sessions with a specific question in mind so we can focus on their specific needs.</p>

              <h3>Parent Reviews</h3>
              <p>"Our tutor responds quick to any questions I as a parent may have. She is assertive and has great power point slides that provide sample math questions which make it fun and help my child feel engaged. Our tutor goes above and beyond and I'm happy that we are aligned on the same goals for my student!"</p>
              <p>"My child is able to excel in math and get more practice with our tutor when she's unclear on topics from school."</p>
